### An Addendum
Hey all, it's Rich. As you may have heard, I got a teaching job at Franklin Central High School teaching computer science. Things have been going well so far, but I do miss you all. I can't say with any certainty when I might see you again, but I'm sure Mr. Schmitt will keep me in the loop when your competitions get scheduled. If only the team had an online calendar. Besides, FCHS doesn't have an FRC team, so you know I'm still rooting for you. I'm especially bummed because this is senior year for so many of you, and now the closest thing you have to a software developer is an engineering teacher that looks like a wrestling coach. The good news is that engineering teacher overspecced in commitment and he's gonna pour more effort into figuring out how to hack together some code than most coaches in the state would even consider. Plus you've still got Mason and since all issues can be fixed in code, what is there to worry about?

Good luck and drive like hell,
Rich
